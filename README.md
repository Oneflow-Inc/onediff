# OneDiff

**An out-of-the-box acceleration library for diffusion models**  (especially for ComfyUI, HF diffusers, and Stable Diffusion web UI).

## Easy to use
- Acceleration for popular UIs/libs
  - [ComfyUI](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/tree/main/onediff_comfy_nodes)
  - [HF diffusers ðŸ¤—](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/tree/main/examples)
  - [Stable Diffusion web UI](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/tree/main/onediff_sd_webui_extensions)
- Acceleration for state-of-the-art Models
  - [SDXL](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/main/examples/text_to_image_sdxl.py)
  - [SDXL Turbo](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/main/examples/text_to_image_sdxl_turbo.py)
  - [SD 1.5/2.1](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/main/examples/text_to_image.py)
  - [LoRA (and dynamic switching LoRA)](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/main/examples/text_to_image_sdxl_lora.py)
  - [ControlNet](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/main/examples/text_to_image_controlnet.py)
  - [LCM](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/main/examples/text_to_image_lcm.py) and [LCM LoRA](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/main/examples/text_to_image_lcm_lora_sdxl.py)
  - [Stable Video Diffusion](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/main/examples/image_to_video.py)
  - [DeepCache for ComfyUI](https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff/blob/8a35a9e7df45bbfa5bb05011b8357480acb5836e/onediff_comfy_nodes/_nodes.py#L414)
