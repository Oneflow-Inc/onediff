### Quick Start

> Recommend running the official example of ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus now, and then trying OneDiff acceleration. 

Experiment (NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB) Workflow for OneDiff Acceleration in ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus:

1. Replace the **`Load Checkpoint`** node with **`Load Checkpoint - OneDiff`** node. 
2. Add a **`Batch Size Patcher`** node before the **`Ksampler`** node (due to temporary lack of support for dynamic batch size).
As follows:
